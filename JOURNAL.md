## July 3rd [2025-06-03]

Idea was conceptualized today and most of the engineering goals were set. theyre also decribed in the readme

engineering goals: 
- low profile
- split, column stagger; perfectly ergonomic for my habds
- wireless (bluetooth) and thus battery powered
- silent for use in shared spaces
- USB C charger
- OLED starys screen for modes and stats
- sculpted and colored keycaps (no text)
- retro techy look: lots of clear plastic (resin printing?)

I also decided on the following tools: 
- Ergopad: finger spacing and splay
- Ergogen: key placement, pcb, outline, etc
- KiCad: PCB
- inkscape: svg and dxf editing for laser cut
- fusion 360: (optional) 3d modelling
